# React Quiz App

This is a simple React-based quiz app where users can answer multiple-choice questions. At the end of the quiz, users are shown their score, and based on the number of correct answers, they will either see a "Game Over!" or "Well Played!" message.

## Features:
- **Dynamic quiz questions** loaded from a JSON file.
- **Timer** between each question to add a delay before moving to the next one.
- **Game Over** and **Well Played** messages based on the score at the end of the quiz.
- **Responsive design** that works well on both desktop and mobile.

## Prerequisites:
Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js**: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
